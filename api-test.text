Auth-api
--------
Registration: 
1. If we try to register again with already registered user it gives 400 with no body
2. It says 400 with no body, if full name field is missing. But for other field it gives specific response body
3. We can just pass all whitespace as full name
4. If confirm pass doesnt match it says 400 with no response body

Login:
1. Remember me is optional - need to check if it actual works, as response body does have effect
2. It gives 400 status with no response body for wrong email/pass
3.

Logout:
1. It doesnt need any auth and always gives 200 with 
{"message": "User logged out successfully!"}

User-api
--------
ChangePassword:
1. it allows ""(empty) or only white space in all fields
2. confirmNewPassword doesnt need to match with newPassword,
3. confirmNewPassword field is not needed to make a request
5. if current password is wrong, it only gives 400 wih no response body
6. suggestion: ChangePassword api should not need authentication, otherwise user who
                is logged out and forgot pass, wont be able to ChangePassword

GetUserProfile
1. role shows "USER" but login/Registration api says "ROLE_USER"

UpdateUserProfile:
1. We can send empty{} object and get successfull response. Though the data doesnt Change
2. if we update the email field, its gives 400, but still the email gets changed.
3. if we change the email, the auth token gets invalid
4. fullName and profilePicture allows only whitespace

Images-api
----------
Upload Image:
1. No checking of file type, one can even Upload exe file and its even downloadable
2. I dont want to check the maxfile size with GB but i've checked with 100mb+ file.
    So i am asuming that it doesnt have any file size check.
3. It retains original image size( which can be a requirement)
4. Swagger shows request body needs to be json file
5. Authentication takes longer for large file and faster for smaller file.

Upload Multiple:
1. Max 10 file at time




DownloadImage: 
1. Should require authorization
